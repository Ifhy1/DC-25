                <h2>All My Love & Wishes for You 💕</h2>
                <p>Watching you find your forever person fills my heart with so much happiness. 
                  May your marriage be filled with as much joy as you've brought into my life and twice as much love as you've given to everyone around you. 
                  May you have as much laughter as we've shared together, as much adventure as your heart can hold, and as much peace as you need in quiet moments.
                   Through every season, every challenge, every beautiful moment - may you always find your way back to each other. 
                   Thank you for being the best sister anyone could ask for. Now go be the most amazing wife too. I'm so proud of you, and I'll always be here for you.</p>
                <h3>With all my love,</h3>
